# ImpersonatorBot

This bot scans reddit comments and impersonates users on command.

Impersonations are generated with a python package called Markovify, which uses natural language processing to analyze text patterns. The bot will output a sentence that is indiccative of what you talk about and the way you say it.

Currently this bot only works in /r/test, but I plan on expanding its reach soon!

To call the bot, post this comment:

```
ImpersonatorBot! <redditUserName>
```

ImpersonatorBot should respond within a minute or two.

Enjoy!
